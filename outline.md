After having spent a couple of weeks working with
react/react-native we want to dive a little deeper
into the more complex parts of react:

- using props
- using states and setState
- using contexts
- using refs
- lifecycle of react components and the lifecycle methods
- testing of react components
- using veer/flux to connect components and services
- which native components can we use with react-native out-of-the-box?

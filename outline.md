After having spent a couple of weeks working with
react/react-native we want to dive a little deeper
into the more complex parts of react:

- basics - x
- using states and setState - x
- using props
- using contexts - x
- using refs - x
- lifecycle of react components and the lifecycle methods - x
    - shouldComponentUpdate and performance
- testing of react components
    - web - x
    - native
- using veer/flux to connect components and services
- which native components can we use with react-native out-of-the-box?
